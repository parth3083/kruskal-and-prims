I have developed a web application that applies the graph computation techniques of Kruskal and Prim. This project has an easy-to-use portal where you may enter graph-related variables, such edge weights and vertices. The webpage effectively computes the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) when the data is supplied by utilising both the Kruskal and Prim methods. It is a helpful tool for comprehending graph theory and algorithmic ideas since users can see and contrast the outcomes for the MST produced by these two algorithms.
